# UIUC energy model project
A model detailing the energy systems mix employed at UIUC will be simulated using [osier](https://github.com/arfc/osier). Single and multiple objective scenarios will be used. Model will be used to write an abstract for the ANS conference. [osier] was developed by [Sam Dotson](https://github.com/samgdotson)
